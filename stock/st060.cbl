*>    Remarks.            Stock Item File Importer.
*>                        This program can be used to import stock records from another
*>                        system or software package.
*>                        HOWEVER it will need to be modified to reflect the format
*>                        and layout of the old system.
*>                        Before any changes to this make a back up copy of the original
*>                        prior to any changes.
*>                        The form of the old data can vary as support for file created from
*>                        most can be imported including RDBMS such as MySQL and SqLite.
*>
*>                        We can undertake this service on
*>                        receipt of the first five records both as a file dump and a
*>                        full listing/s (containing as many of the data fields that is
*>                        used as possible as well as the full file to be imported.
*>                        If you have it, the record layout of the file from the
*>                        documentation of the old system or from their technical support
*>                        department if they are still in business.
*>                        Otherwise:
*>
*>                        It is recommended to create the five records using the lowest
*>                        values for the stock number eg, 0000000test1 though 000000test5
*>                        and all numeric fields 1234567 etc and likewise money fields with
*>                        say 123456.78 or 987654.32 etc. Also alphabetic fields eg, item
*>                        descriptions with 'abcdefghijklmnop' or 'mlkjihgfedcba' etc.
*>                        This will help in examining the file for the correct layout for
*>                        each field.
*>                        This is a chargeable service and is charged at the rate of
*>                        25 pounds sterling per hour with a maximum of eight hours but
*>                        the average is five. Contact via email to vbcoen@gmail.com.

*>                        This program assumes that the supplier information is NOT

*>                        WS-Default-Supplier and you will need to manually add/change

*>
*>                        You then need to test it to make sure that it is working correctly

*>                        It is strongly recommended that all initial testing is only
