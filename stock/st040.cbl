*>                    Stock-Abrev-Key, Stock-Desc by WS- to reflect that we
*>                    are only dealing with a WS record and the FD is now gone.
*>                    Stop using File-Status and replace with call to
*>                    "CBL_CHECK_FILE_EXIST" instead. Do same for all such
*>                    checks, sets etc to kill of usage dates back to floppies.

*>                    where and taken from todays date, if day < 5 month is last month
*>                    else this month (day > 27).
