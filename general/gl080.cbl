*>                        Clear down old posting records having made
*>                        an archive of them to a specified path,
*>                        eg a previously MOUNTED memory stick.
*>
*>                        This function will only run if Archiving is set to Yes
*>                        in the system parameter file under G/L for Cobol files.
*>                        It will also check if there are any non proofed or
*>                        posted batches present and exit with a message GL088.
*>
*>                        For RDB usage it is not needed as the RDB system will be
*>                        running back ups daily or more often assuming you have
*>                        turned on such back ups frequently, eg, hourly/daily.
*>                        However these is no difference in processing for RDB.
*>
*>                        However For Cobol file processing, this is a bit moot
*>                        assuming system makes a back up after processing, e.g.,
*>                        when exiting the system, this is the same for all

*>
*>                        This process is a hold over from usage of floppies
*>                        as the main storage medium for all files.
*>                        It is, based on old systems converted to the original
*>                        Personal Computers and as of now.
*>
*>                        Note that IRS does not do this but retains the posting
*>                        until End of Year where it can be then cleared by user
