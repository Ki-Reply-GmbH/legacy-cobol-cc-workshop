*>    Remarks.          G/L System Menu.
*>                      GL is based in part from irs that pre-dates it in that it
*>                      uses default accounting to prevent out of balance
*>                      accounts using similar / same code.
*>
*>                      However after that, GL moves away from IRS because of
*>                      support of Multiple Profit Centres or Branch accounting.
*>                      This support make G/L more complex in design and
*>                      therefore to use. design in part based on two older
*>                      system in use from the 70s.
*>                      It requires an accountancy background to design the CoA
*>                      for the user company so that all processing and printed
*>                      reports behave & look correct as required by the user.
*>
*>                      This will require extensive testing of the CoA to ensure
*>                      that the results come out as needed.
*>
*>                      For usage of a General / Nominal Ledger system that does
*>                      not require MPC or Branch support it is recommended to
*>                      use the IRS system instead, although both can be used at
*>                      the same time as the other systems, Sales, Purchase,
*>                      Stock etc will issue posting to both, one or other at the
*>                      same time providing that the account numbers match each
*>                      other as set up in the system parameter file where such
*>                      posting are sent to. Might be easier said than done.
*>
*>                      Another primary issue is the way GL handles the postings
*>                      and the postings records - As is SL060 & 100 and PL060
*>                      and PL100 will post transactions of SL invoices and
*>                      payments and PL tranactions and payments to IRS and/or
*>                      GL and while for IRS they go into a different file which
*>                      is posted via an IRS menu option to the IRS posting
*>                      record and updates the Nominal accounts at the same time
*>                      IRS also has a process that will clear down all account
*>                      totals and using the posting records repost to the
*>                      accounts.   GL does NOT have this facility and it needs
*>                      to be examined if sending of posting data to its posting
*>                      file directly is the correct waay of doing this process.
*>
*>                      I suspect it is not as GL may well work same as IRS in
*>                      processing new posting entries both to the posting file
*>                      AND the nominal ledger accounts which would get broken
*>                      if SL and PL sends this data to this file and not a
*>                      secondary file that gets read and the GL postings and NL
*>                      updated.   Date 5 October 2025 Vincent Coen.
*>
*>                      IF this needs to be changed then SL060,100, PL060,100
*>                      will needs changes in BL-Write routines and possibly
