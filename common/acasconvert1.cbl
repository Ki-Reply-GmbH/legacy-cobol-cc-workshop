*>Purpose.                   Convert an existing ACAS IRS default file only.
*>
*>
*>     This program and others starting with acasconvertn (n = 1 thru 99) is
*>     for updating the data file layouts from one version to the next when
*>     required.  File layout changes are kept to a minimum but some times
*>     it is necessary.
*>
*>     THIS Version updates the IRS Default record ONLY as the record size
*>      now supports default 33 which is ONLY a place holder used in the
*>      irs030 posting program for a tempoarary default and is discarded
*>      when the posting program finishes.
*>     The program renames file to irsdflt.saved before processing.
*>
*>     There is NO change to the RDB table.
