*>        This module has been taken from the first written acas011 (along with its DAL module)
*>          which was the first FH (cobol File Handler for I/O)
*>            and DAL (Data Access Layer) for RDBMS direct I/O processing and these two modules
*>                 are the first modules written (& tested) for the ACAS system and specifically
*>                  for stock control.
*>
*>        Therefore they are the models for all other FH and DALs.
*>          This means that any bugs found in one of them that is NOT file specific code changes
*>            have to be added to all existing other FH and or DAL modules.
*>               This must be done immediately after all changes to any one so that no mods are

*>
*>                      This modules does all Cobol file handling for the file
*>                                 (Batch).
*>
*>                      If Cobol Flat files are in use (via the system parameter file settings)
*>                      which is passed via the wsfnctn (via copybook) / File-Access data block
*>                      via the application module and each FH & DAL.
*>                      It will read/write/delete/update/open/close as required and requested.
*>                      NOTE the same fields are used for ALL of the FL and DAL modules so
*>                      checking the error flags have to be done after each call before clearing.
*>
*>                      If RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management Systems) is in use it will call
*>                      the specific module to handle similar processing passing the equivelent
*>                      RDB (Relational DataBase) row as a Cobol file record (01 level) moving
*>                      row by row to the correct Cobol flat file fields as required.
*>                      These retrieve ALL columns and there fore the DAL modules cannot handle
*>                      processing for selective columns, e.g., only updating one field/column
*>                      as the whole record / row must be read or written to/from the RDB table.
*>
*>                      Module naming is based on the original irsubn FH the FH is therefore acasirs1
*>                       - the last one char
*>                      reflect the same number as one char in the 'irsubn' name.
*>
*>                      RDB DAL (Data Access Layer) modules are individually modified to handle:
*>                      MS SQL server, Mysql, DB2, Postgres and Oracle as available and tested.
*>                      These are contained in seperate directories for each RDB, eg
*>                       'MSSQL' (MS SQL Server), 'Mysql', 'DB2', 'Postgres'. 'Oracle'.
*>                       You need to compile from the correct directory for the specific
*>                       RDB you will use and have installed along with all of the development
*>                       libraries and include files etc using the correct pre-compiler tool
*>                       to process the 'EXEC SQL' code converting to Cobol calls etc.
*>
*>                      For specific SQL servers supported the pre-compiler system is included
*>                       where ever possible but for some, copyright reasons may prevent
*>                       inclusion. In some cases for one specific RDB more than one precompiler
*>                       is used as an experiment to help find the ideal one to use.
*>
*>                      In addition:
*>                        If the system has been set up to (see the System File set up via the
*>                        main menu module for each sub system), also process BOTH flat file
*>                        AND the correct rdb table/s,
*>                        it will write/delete/update etc to both but read from 1=Flat and be
*>                        overwritten by the rdb access. This was set up more for testing the
*>                        new code for both cobol files and the rdb accessing modules.
*>                       This can help in transferring the Cobol flat files to rdb tables but
*>                        see below regarding the Load programs/modules.
*>
*>                      If you wish to convert a running ACAS system over from Flat files
*>                      to RDBMS see below. However it is strongly recommended to not to use
*>                      the Duplicate processing of files/table as outlined above but:
*>
*>                      Included are LMs (Load Modules) to convert each ISAM
*>                      (Indexed Sequential) file to the rdb database tables if you wish to
*>                      convert the system in one hit, without using the Duplicate file/RDB
*>                      processing procedures. These will also need to be compiled from the
*>                      specific LM directory that contains the rdb DAL modules.
*>
*>                      A specific program or bash process will be created to use, that will run
*>                      each LM process for all existing Cobol files. These are created during
*>                      writing of the FH and DAL for each file/table if only to help in testing
