*>                      This module is a ACAS File Handlers and is taken from

*>**
*> Changes.
*> 10/11/16 vbc - .04 Taken from ACAS FH stock.
*> 22/12/16 vbc - .05 Added extra code to handle open output which clears all data
*>                    for Cobol file and likewise set up DAL to do similar.
*>                .06 Added write-raw for nominalLD. Now will it work!
*> 28/01/18 vbc - .07 Updated copy for using copybooks dir.
*> 14/02/18 vbc - .08 Mapped error msgs to module specifics IR90n.
*> 28/02/18 vbc - .09 Added recs test for FH at ba012-Test-WS-Rec-Size-2
*> 20/04/18 vbc - .10 Move key to ws-file-key on error read indexed
*>                    Change code for open I/O NOT to close open output etc but give error cond
*>                    also give fs-reply to we-error if 47, 48, 49 to try and find error in caller
*>                    that is opening an already open file. Found it in irs030 (SL/PL posting file proc.
*> 23/04/18 vbc - .11 Extra code in open and read indexed.
