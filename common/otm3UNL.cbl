*>                       If the file exists but produces any errors because of
*>                       a bad file** etc, it will attempt to read the RDB table
*>                       instead, and a message to that effect will be issued.
*>
*>                       ** This can occur if a change of ISAM library is used
*>                       where the new one is incompatable with the old one.
*>
*>                       ALL program output goes to file SYS-DISPLAY.log as an
