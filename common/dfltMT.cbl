*>
*>                      This and associated modules relate to ACAS versions v3.02 and later.
*>
*>                      This modules does all file handling using RDB and is called
*>                      from the ACAS
*>                      dflt (as well as final, system-4 and system) file handler acas000
*>                      which in turn is called
*>                      from each ACAS application module that requires file/RDB data handling.
*>
*>                      If RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management Systems) is in use it will be
*>                      called by the specific module to handle similar processing as a Cobol
*>                      flat file and will pass the equivelent
*>                      RDB (Relational DataBase) row as a Cobol file record (01 level) moving
*>                      row by row to the correct Cobol flat file fields as required.
*>
*>                      RDB DAL (Data Access Layer) modules are individually modified to handle:
*>                      MS SQL server, Mysql, DB2, Postgres and Oracle as available and tested.
*>                      These are contained in seperate directories for each RDB, eg
*>                       'MSSQL' (MS SQL Server), 'Mysql', 'DB2', 'Postgres'. 'Oracle'.
*>                       You need to compile from the correct directory for the specific
*>                       RDB you will use and have installed along with all of the development
*>                       libraries and include files etc using the correct pre-compiler tool
*>                       to process the 'EXEC SQL' code converting to Cobol calls etc.
*>                       see the RDB specific ACAS notes.
*>
*>                      For specific SQL servers supported, the pre-compiler system is included
*>                       where ever possible but for some, copyright reasons may prevent
*>                       inclusion. In some cases for one specific RDB more than one precompiler
*>                       is used as an experiment to help find the ideal one to use.
*>
*>                      In addition:
*>                        If the system has been set up to (see the System File set up via the
*>                        main menu module for each sub system), it will also process BOTH flat
*>                        file  AND the correct rdb tables,
*>
*>                        it will write/delete/update etc to both but read from 1=Flat and be
*>                        overwritten by the rdb access if data is present.
*>                       This will help in transferring the Cobol flat files to rdb tables.
*>
*>                      If you wish to convert a running ACAS system over from Flat files
*>                      to RDBMS see below. However it is recommended to use the Duplicate
*>                      processing of files/table as outlined above where no or very low
*>                      data records exist:
*>
*>                      Depending on the RDB you wish to use there is
*>                      also, included LMs (Load Modules) to convert each ISAM
*>                      (Indexed Sequential) file to the rdb database tables if you wish to
*>                      convert the system in one hit, without using the Duplicate file/RDB
*>                      processing procedures. These will also need to be compiled from the
*>                      specific LM directory that contains the rdb DAL modules.
*>                      These will be very RDB specific.
*>
*>                      For a existing running ACAS system using the Load modules AND
*>                      not using the dup processing process as indicated above is the
*>                      recommended way to go.

*>**
*> Version.             1.00 17/06/2016.
*>
*>**
*> Changes.
*> 04/08/16 vbc - .01 Removed file action logging to sep. module ditto acas011.
*> 18/07/16 vbc - .02 Insert call for SQL error msg where missing and move
*>                    spaces / zero to SQL-Msg| Err and other little fixes/cleanups.
*>                    Remap all changes to the .scb source file.
*> 20/07/16 vbc - .03 Close logger if testing-1 set on table close.
*>                    branch to 999-end instead of 998-free when EOF on read next.
*>                    Seems to auto release if end of cursor data reached
*>                    and causes an abort ??
*> 24/07/16 vbc -     Taken from the stockMT sources with same versioning.
*> 30/07/16 vbc - .04 Change Open and Close to also show table name in operation.
*> 31/07/16 vbc - .05 Moved mv spaces/zero in Write to before insert.
*>                    Remove fhlogger file close in Process-Close.
*>                    Forgot error 989 so commented.
*> 27/08/16 vbc -     Taken from systemMT with same versioning.
*> 18/09/16 vbc -     Temp added code to find out why a SQL error happens turned out
*>                    that using as a SL or PL delimiter a \ screws it up when processing
*>                    as it would need another '\'. There are others '
*>                    This could also be a problem for name and address fields.<<<<<
*>                    May be its to do with the windoz path type delim.
*>                    Solution do NOT use it.
*> 23/09/16 vbc - .06 Removed the lock/unlock as these are not needed with Mysql as
*>                    it will do itself when using select + update/delete according to
*>                    "Definitive guide to MySQL 5 page 254" see text :
*> Tips MySQL always executes individual commands in such a way that they cannot be
*> influenced by other commands. Therefore, no locking is necessary for a single command
*> UPDATE … WHERE id=1234 or DELETE …WHERE id=5678.
*> You need to execute locking only if you are executing several interdependent commands
*> during which another client should not alter the underlying data. Usually, that is the
*> case when you first execute a SELECT command and then process the resulting data with an
*> UPDATE or DELETE command.
*> LOCK and UNLOCK should not be used for InnoDB tables. With older versions of MySQL
*> (< 4.0.22), the locking mechanisms of MySQL and InnoDB can get in each other’s way. LOCK
*> also ends the current transaction, which is often an undesired outcome. Instead, use
*> transactions that block only individual records (instead of entire tables).
*> If you really wish to block an entire InnoDB table, there is available a new command,
*> since MySQL 5.0.3, namely, LOCK TABLE[S] TRANSACTIONAL.
*>
*>  REMEMBER to remove for all other DAL units.
*>
*> 25/09/16 vbc - .07 Changed for one Cobol File/Record to many table rows - dfltMT and finalMT.
*> 05/11/16 vbc - .08 Changes table occurs from 33 to 32 - error in original record layout
*> 17/11/16 vbc - .09 Test for empty occurs in file rec and dont write out.
*> 09/12/16 vbc - .10 Make functions 3 & 4 both read-next as in acas000 its indexed
*>                    and in the DAL it is next.
*> 01/03/18 vbc - .11 Renamed error messages to SM901, SM004 as needed.
*> 07/12/22 vbc - .12 Chgd Vars A & B to pic 999 to keep GC v3.2 happy.
*> 16/04/24 vbc       Copyright notice update superseding all previous notices.
*> 19/09/25 vbc -3.3.00 Version update and builds reset.
