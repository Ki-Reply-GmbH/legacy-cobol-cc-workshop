*> Changes.
*> 03/11/16 vbc - .05 Taken from acasirsub1 replacing irsub3.
*> 28/01/18 vbc - .06 Updated copy for using copybooks dir.
*> 14/02/18 vbc - .07 Mapped error msgs to module specifics IR91n.
*> 28/02/18 vbc - .08 Added recs test for FH at ba012-Test-WS-Rec-Size-2
*> 03/03/18 vbc - .09 Renumbered error messages 911-13 to 917-919 due to clash
*>                    in DALs.
*> 29/04/18 vbc - .10 Remarked out Open and Close processes as it only does
*>                    Read Next and Write which both open, read/write, close in
*>                    one operation. Removed tests for File-Key-No.
*> 06/05/18 vbc - .11 No program source change other than increase record size
*>                    from 256 to 264, as dflt has been changed to support
*>                    temp. default 33 as a place holder for the posting program
*>                    irs030. For existing data program acasconvert1 MUST be run prior
*>                    to use. THERE IS NO CHANGE to RDB TABLE or DAL.
*> 07/12/22 vbc - .12 Chgd Vars A & B to pic 999 toi keep GC v3.2 happy.
*> 10/12/22 vbc - .13 chg to perform ba-Process-RDBMS 2 remove GC warning msg from latest v3.2 code
*>                    WITH ba-Main-Exit chgd to exit section.
