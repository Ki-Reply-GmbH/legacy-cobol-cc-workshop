*>           13/06/23   Updated for PUAUTOGEN record layouts differences.
*>
*>                      This version uses an amended JC pre-Sql processor.
*>                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*>
*>  This module and that for the FH handles one record at a time for
*>    the header and the invoice lines based on the key last two digits
*>      being 00 or not respectively.
*>
*>===========================================================================
*>
*> Coding completed but needs dry testing and verifying against sales to see
*>  what functions are used and how to confirm correct logic.
*>
*>          Logic to be used:  [ for programmer ]
*>
*>                      THIS module handles two tables - primary and a secondary one
*>                      The primary (PUAUTOGEN-REC) has all columns that directly link
*>                      to the Cobol file Header data and
*>                      PUAUTOGEN-LINES-REC for up to 40 rows for those both using the
*>                      same key for the search. This hold the invoice item lines with one
*>                      row per line. This table only holds this record type.
*>
*>                      Both of these tables consist of the existing Cobol file records.
*>
*>                      During processing for write, rewrite, delete, seek/search operations
*>                      will examine the last two chars of the key (Line or test) and if
*>                      zero its a main table row and if 01 - 40 is a Line item row so
*>                      easy to work out where to write out to.
*>
*>                      FOR start we do for both tables saving into -RG1.
*>                         See if we need this code  ????????
*>
*>                      Reading both next and indexed is a little more complex :
*>
*>                      Read next needs to know what the previous record key (test) was so if
*>                      it is:
*>                      If 00 then read line table for same invoice starting at 01  and at
*>                      invoice change read primary table.
*>
*>                      if not 00 then read line table unless invoice changed then
*>                      change to primary read.
*>
*>                      If read indexed if test = 00 use primary otherwise use
*>                      line table.
*>
*>                      So we need to keep track of previous read key and operation ?
*>                      and the prior key (JIC).
*>
*>===========================================================================
*>
*>                      This and associated modules relate to ACAS versions v3.02 and later.
*>
*>                      This modules does all file handling using RDB and is called
*>                      from the ACAS
*>                      Purchase Autogen file handler acas030
*>                      which in turn is called
*>                      from each ACAS application module that requires file/RDB data handling.
*>
*>                      If RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) is in use it will be
*>                      called by the specific module to handle similar processing as a Cobol
*>                      flat file and will pass the equivalent
*>                      RDB (Relational Database) row as a Cobol file record (01 level) moving
*>                      row by row to the correct Cobol flat file fields as required.
*>
*>                      RDB DAL (Data Access Layer) modules are individually modified to handle:
*>                      MS SQL server, Mysql, DB2, Postgres and Oracle as available and tested.
*>                      These are contained in separate directories for each RDB, e.g.
*>                       'MSSQL' (MS SQL Server), 'Mysql', 'DB2', 'Postgres'. 'Oracle'.
*>                       You need to compile from the correct directory for the specific
*>                       RDB you will use and have installed along with all of the development
*>                       libraries and include files etc using the correct pre-compiler tool
*>                       to process the Exec SQL code converting to Cobol calls etc.
*>                       see the RDB specific ACAS notes.
*>
*>                      For specific SQL servers supported, the pre-compiler system is included
*>                       where ever possible but for some, copyright reasons may prevent
*>                       inclusion. In some cases for one specific RDB more than one precompiler
*>                       is used as an experiment to help find the ideal one to use.
*>
*>                      If you wish to convert a running ACAS system over from Flat files
*>                      to RDBMS see below.
*>
*>                      Depending on the RDB you wish to use there is
*>                      also, included LMs (Load Modules) to convert each ISAM
*>                      (Indexed Sequential) file to the rdb database tables.
*>                      These will also need to be compiled from the
*>                      specific LM directory that contains the rdb DAL modules.
*>                      These will be very RDB specific.
*>
*>    As the MySQL versioning is the first of the DAL and FH processes being
*>    developed all sources are in the common directory.
*>**
*>  File Handling:
*>     Uses the Global Error / Access logging file within the FH acas0nn module
*>               and in all DALs.
*>**
*> Called by Modules:
*>                      acas030 - Purchase Autogen Cobol Handler.

*> Error Messages Used.
*>                      SM004 SQL Err no in 'mysql-procedures'
