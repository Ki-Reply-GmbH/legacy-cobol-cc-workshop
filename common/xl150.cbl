*>  You MUST have run invoices and payment proofs,      *
*>   postings & analysis runs FIRST before running      *
*>   XL150 otherwise you will lose information / data.  *

*>                                                      *
*>  These msut be run in order -
*>  1.  Sales proof,
*>  2.  Sales Picking/Packing note prints and this always *
*>    done  before invoices.
*>  3.  Sales Invoices prints
*>  4.  Sales proof report
*>  5.  Sales posting
*>
*>   Next the same for Purchase Ledger.
*>
*>    All analysis, customer reports for both systems.
*>
*>    This is also a good time to run of the Stock
*>    reports so you have end of period status on paper
*>    include the stock control report to verify stock
*>    holdings match the computer records.
*>    For any differences find out why and as needed
*>    update Stock control records via stock additions or
*>    Stock Deductions.
*>                                                      *
*>    End of cycle can be :                             *
*>         Monthly, Quarterly and more importantly      *
*>           EOY (End of Year).                         *
*>    For EOY it will reset the yearly stats for all    *
*>      Ledger records (both Live and dead) as well as  *
*>       the analysis totals. SO it it important that   *
*>       you have run off all ledger & analysis reports *
*>       for both Sales and Purchase                    *
*>       BEFORE running this program.                   *

*> Processing:                                          *
*>    For monthly & quarterly it will update records    *
*>       in the Ledgers, for invoices will delete line  *
*>       records and delete invoice headers if closed   *
*>       and paid.                                      *
*>       Note that there are two invoice files for each *
*>       ledger - the main, which contains invoice line *
*>       items and the header record - these are        *
*>       deleted after a proof report, invoices printed *
*>       and posted to the OTM file.
*>
*>       The second is                                  *
*>       OTM (Open Item File) which contains unpaid     *
*>       invoices and these are deleted after being     *
*>       paid and closed after months end & statement   *
*>       produced by email or printing.                 *
*>
*>       As Deleted records will still take up space in *
*>       the Cobol files are well as most RDBMS another *
*>       process is run at start of a new year to clear *
*>       these out by saving data to temp files and     *
*>       then reloading these files.                    *
*>
*>       This is a major reason for ensuring that Back  *
*>       Ups are run PRIOR to running XL150.            *
*>       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  *
*>                                                      *
*>    For users of the RDB data systems the data reload *
*>      is done using the RDB system itself by using    *
*>      the RDB utilities. See the RDB manuals.         *
*>                                                      *
*>      When running End of Cycle you must ensure that  *
*>      all proofing reports have been produced as well *
*>      as posting all invoices, payments and printing  *
*>      the analysis reports.                           *

*>    IF using Autorun you MUST ensure that all         *
*>    required computers are on likewise ALL required   *
*>    printers are on with plenty of paper.             *
*>
*>    These process could produce (if not already run,  *

*>    ^^^^^^^^^^^
*>                    If using Autorun, will run any outstanding processes such as:

*>                    Purchase PO proof, print Purchase orders & then posting.
*>                    Only then will xl150 continue.
*>                    If not using Autorun will stop with error / warning messages if
*>                    needed to be Actioned.
*>
*>                    MORE CODING NEEDED !!!!!!
*>
*>                    IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO RUN XL150 in Autorun as there are required
*>                    processes that might well not have been run.
*>
*>   Functions Added: TO BE Added....
*>
*>                    IRS   ---- NO - done within at user request.
