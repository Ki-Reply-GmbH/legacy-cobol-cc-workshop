*>                        Converts and checks dates in 10 chars to/from
*>                        9(8) bin-long in form dd/mm/ccyy.
*>
*>                        Needs to look at all code using this to see
*>                        if conversion is needed instead of just storing

*> changes:
*> 05/02/02 vbc - Converted to year 2k using dd/mm/yyyy.
*> 29/01/09 vbc - Migration to GNU Cobol & using intrinsic functions
*>                to do most of the work as v1.10 for MAPS04, to help
*>                reduce risk of format change problems in old programs.
*>
*> 19/10/16 vbc - THIS uses binary dates from 31/12/1600 so is NOT usable
*>                 within IRS as is, but in any event uses dates with CC
*>                 e.g., dd/mm/ccyy where as IRS uses dd/mm/yy.
*>                 but fixable within IRS itself.
*> 16/04/24 vbc       Copyright notice update superseding all previous notices.
*> 19/09/25 vbc -3.3.00 Version update and builds reset.
