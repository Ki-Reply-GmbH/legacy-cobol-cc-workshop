*>  This program will call each of the main   *
*>   elements in ACAS via a menu              *
*>    such as irs, General, Stock,            *
*>         Sales, Purchase,                   *
*>     and for non O/S versions :             *
*>         Payroll, Epos, Order Entry.        *
*>    For on-line order entry systems, it is  *
*>    expected that the data export to ACAS   *

*>    system.                                 *
*>*********************************************
*> It is not expected to use this module to   *
*>  run ACAS as most users will just load the *
*>  needed sub-system as they tend to be used *
*>  by differing departments however it does  *
*>  include access to the parameter set up    *
*>  processes where the sub systems have it   *
*>  made non available as set up in the       *
*>  parameter file.                           *
*>                                            *
*>  These extra file set ups for the moment   <
*>   must be run manually as there is no      *
*>   procedure to do it in auto mode:         *
*>  Also this program will set up the system  *
*>  parameter file & also the other required  *
*>   data files needed such as :              *
*>   IRS Ledgers                              *
*>    Using default COA file :                *
*>      coa-achived.txt                       *
*>     So a copy must be made as back up then *
*>      edit original to reflect your         *
*>      requirements FIRST and suggested      *
*>      changes are at PC directors names     *
*>      at lines starting T0018600286O also   *
