*> Remarks.            Sorted Posting File Handler as producd by irs055 (sort).
*>                     Called by irs050 and irs070.
*>
*> Version.            1.10 25/10/1982 Cis Cobol migration.
*>**
*> Changes.
*> 22/01/09 vbc - .11 Migration to Open/Gnu Cobol.
*> 15/02/09 vbc - .12 Produce error 99 if no input file.
*> 07/05/13 vbc -     Change file to line seq in line with 055.
*> 04/12/16 vbc - .13 Removed System-Record from call list but
*>                    added File-Defs as filename now file-38 to
*>                    force file into correct directory as possible bug.
*>                    As this FH is only for a temporary file it will
*>                    not be converted to also use a RDB table.
*>                    As it is only created and
*>                    used within irs055 for irs050.
*>                    Long term would be to just extract rdb rows in the
*>                    requested sorted order but as a primary sort field
*>                    is the date elements (dd/mm/yy) & the date is stored
*>                    as one column this cannot be done short of having
*>                    three new column to hold DD, MM & YY.
*>                    Hmm, might do it anyway but the sort is very quick!
*> 29/01/18 vbc - .14 Clean up copy books to use default dir BUT the
*>                    wspost.cob is in the irs dir as it is different.
*>                    So code is now to v3.02 standards - ish.
*> 10/02/18 vbc - .15 Removed o/p and writing as not used as the sort (irs055)
*>                    (writes out within sort verb).
*> 19/04/18 vbc -     Comment for .14 and wspost no longer applies as the posting
*>                    is now setup for irs and a different one from SL & PL.
*>                    All copy books are in the one directory.
*> 16/04/24 vbc       Copyright notice update superseding all previous notices.
*> 20/09/25 vbc -3.3.00 Version update and builds reset.
