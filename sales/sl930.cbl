*>    INVOICE PRINT
*>
*> THERE IS TEST CODE at all-print to force printing even if
*> INVOICES HAVE BEEN PRINTED SO THIS NEEDS TO BE REMOVED
*>   FOR PRODUCTION / SYSTEM TESTING.
*> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*>
*>  THIS PROGRAM MUST BE MODIFIED TO SUIT YOUR INVOICING STATIONERY
*>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*>    Do so in conjunction with SL950 Delivery / Picking Note Print.
*>      and ensure testing with stationery or plain paper
*>
*>  FOR sending Emails as well as invoices, statements & late letters
*>    the delay before deleting the created temporary email files is
*>    in variable  WS-Sleep and is preset to 5 seconds at
*>    program EOJ (End of Job).
*>   Change this if time is wrong but allow extra 2 seconds just in
*>    case.
*>
*> Change variable WS-Emails-Both to zero if you only want to send
*>  emails if the sales record shows an email address and
*>  Email-Invoicing is set.   Default BOTH.
*>
*> PRODUCES TITLES ETC ON PLAIN PAPER
*>
*> MAKE SURE THERE IS A NOTE IN THE SALES Manual Regarding these notes.
*> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*> Changes as of 27 June 2023 and version 3.02.22::
*> Program operation has been changed to reflect usage of Emails using freely
*> available email clients, in that instead of directly creating a invoice
*> print to file or printer it opens it but all individual invoices are sent
*> first to a newly created email file that at end of invoice creation is
*> closed then reopened as INPUT and all records copied over to the invoice
*> where after it is closed and then the zz090-Issue-Email called.
*> This source code may need to be changed to reflect what ever client you are
*> using as currently set to use mailx.
*>
*> This order is important as the email client may not like the file still
*> being open as not being accessable.
*> At EOJ (End of Job) programs sleeps for predefined time current set as
*> 3 seconds, again to allow time for email client to send all email files out
*> before deleting all created files.
*> The Invoice file is closed for printing.
*> To Control this processing see the settings for the following variables :
*>
*> 03  WS-Email-Set    pic 9           value zero.   *> Set to 1 if sending email.
*>         88  WS-Send-Email               value 1.      *>  or should it be instead !!!
*>     03  WS-Sleep        pic 9           value 3.      *> at EOJ in secs to allow all emails to be issued
*>                                                        to the email client.
*>     03  WS-Emails-Both  pic 9           value 1.      *> Set to zero if only emails issued.
*>         88  WS-Emails-Only              value zero.
*>
*>  WS-Emails-Both when set to 1 (default) will send both emails and a printed invoice
*>    but if set to 0 (zero) will only send an email (recommended 1 as default)
*>  This only applies if the individual sales record was set up with an Email address
*>  AND the send email invoice.
*>
*> WS-Email-Set IF you wish to send Emails, set this to 1 instead of zero (default).
*>
*> WS-Sleep is set to 3 (seconds) as the time to wait before deleting the email
*> files and this allows some time for the email client to actual send the emails
*> out as the emails are actually files if the files are deleted it might not find
*> one or more such files when sending if there is a delay it the client processing
*> them.  IF you get errors being reporting that such files are missing from the
*> email client, you should INCREASE the time preset from 3 to a larger number
*> such as say 5 - 10, although 3 should be more than enough but for slower
*> systems it just might not be enough.
*>
*>  Having made changes to these or any other setting in the program you must
*>  re-compile it by running the supplied scripts in folder sales comp-sales.sh
*>  then in top level ACAS install-ACAS-preinstalled.sh if you have installed
*>  the system before or if the first time run instead install-ACAS.sh.
*>  NOTE that you should ONLY run this last script ONCE as it also updates the
*> file ./bashrc with extra setting for the ACAS environment. The script with
*> the ...preinstalled.sh etc should be used otherwise.

*>*****************************************************************
*> Commercial version instead of printing created temp file for   *
*> each inv by a/c name then called a *txt to .pdf file converter *
*> then ran a emailer for customers that requested this method    *
*> of delivery.  These steps could also produce a invoice via     *

*> code refs below.                                               *
*>  You can use the supplied script prtpdf.sh to convert the      *

*>  THIS PROGRAM MUST ALWAYS BE TESTED TO CONFIRM THAT IT WORKS   *
*>  TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS. Likewise sl950 (picking/packing sheets) *
*>   and for that matter Statements production sl190.             *
